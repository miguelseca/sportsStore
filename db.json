      "richDescription": "For day hikers and lightweight backpackers who stick mostly to maintained trails, our top value pick is the Merrell Moab 2. What makes this boot so popular is its lightweight and comfortable feel at such a reasonable price. For $145, you get good cushioning underfoot, trusty Vibram outsoles, and a waterproof membrane (an upgraded Gore-Tex model is available for $165). Updated a few years ago, but they didn't fuss much with the proven design. Notable changes included a new insole with a higher arch, improved cushioning under the heel, and a more waterproof and durable suede upper.",
